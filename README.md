## Alpha Templates
Each of the Alpha templates (A to E) includes the following methodologies:

- **basic**: Raw simulation without filtering.
- **clustering**: Parameter sorting using K-means clustering, with threshold evaluation using the Scoring method.
- **daedalus**: Implementation of sorting and thresholding on Daedalus simulation.
- **mixing**: Combining selected Alphas to create a new Alpha.

## Results
Simulation results for each stage are provided in `stats.csv` files:

- **basic**: Results from the basic simulation.
- **clustering**: Results from the clustering simulation.
- **mixing**: Results from the mixing simulation.
- **signal**: Converted Alpha expression files for mixing.
